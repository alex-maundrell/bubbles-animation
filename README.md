I watched a few videos about animations using CSS and decided to try it myself. Since this is page has started out as a tutorial, I am going to use this page on my portfolio site after I have made some major alterations. At this time, I am creating my portfolio site.

I will leave links to the live page on netlify as soon as it is completed. A quesiton that I am currently asking myself; will animations such as these bubbles render properly on a mobile? I will soon find out...
