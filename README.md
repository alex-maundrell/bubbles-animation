I have been interested in CSS animations and found this tutorial on YouTube. I leanred a bit more about them and as a by product, I learned more about position: absolute; This is just the beginning of my animation tour. At this time, this is my first animation tutorial. I'll be adding more to GitHub as I complete them. Both tutorials and my own creations.

A quesiton that I am currently asking myself; will animations such as these bubbles render properly on a mobile? I will soon find out...
