I watched a few videos about animations using CSS and decided to try it myself. Eventually, I am going to use this page as one of my pages on my portfolio site, which is currently in the making. I will leave links to a live site on netlify as soon as it is completed. A quesiton that I am currently asking myself; will animations such as these bubbles render properly on a mobile? I will soon find out...
